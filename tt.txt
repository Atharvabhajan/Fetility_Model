🧠 Model Development Approach

Our recommendation model was developed through a thoughtful, multi-step, industry-standard pipeline.

⿡ Data Understanding & Feature Engineering

We extracted meaningful product-level features such as:

Product title

Description / blurb

Category & metadata

Style and functional attributes

These were converted into dense semantic embeddings using a transformer-based encoder (Sentence-BERT / MiniLM style embeddings).

These embeddings capture:

Product similarity

Style similarity

Functional similarity

which become the backbone of the recommendation engine.

⿢ Content-Based Similarity Model (Core of the System)

We compute cosine similarity between product embeddings to identify products closest to the user's interest profile.

This model demonstrated exceptional performance:

Hit@10 = 0.9398

NDCG@10 = 0.5781

This means:

For 94% of users, the correct product appears in the top 10 recommendations, and relevant items are ranked very high.

⿣ Hybrid Scoring Engine

To complement content similarity, a hybrid scoring formula was developed:

FinalScore = α × Behavioral_Score  +  (1 - α) × Content_Similarity


We tested α from 0.0 to 1.0 and found the optimum near:

α = 0.2 → balanced behavior + semantic relevance

Very close performance to content model but more robust

This hybrid model ensures personalization is meaningful even as the system grows.

⿤ LLM Explanation Generator

To make recommendations transparent and user-friendly, we integrated a Large Language Model (LLM).

For each recommended product, the LLM generates:

✔ A short marketing-style blurb
✔ A detailed, human-readable explanation:

Example:

“This product is recommended because you prefer eco-friendly activewear and have shown interest in sustainable apparel.”

This elevates the system from a “black box” model to an explainable AI system.

🔢 What is the “Score” Shown in the Output?

Each recommendation card displays a score, which represents:

“How strongly the system believes this product matches the user's preferences.”

Score is derived from:

Hybrid relevance score

Semantic similarity

Weighted ranking adjustments

Content-based embedding closeness

Scores are normalized between 0 and ~0.2 depending on model calibration.

A higher score = higher ranking = more relevant recommendation.
